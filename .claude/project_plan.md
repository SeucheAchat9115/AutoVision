# Extended AutoVision Project Plan

## Stage 1: Core MVP & Foundational Setup üì¶

### Development & Environment:

- **Project Initialization**: Project initialized using `uv` to create and manage virtual environment (`uv venv`)
- **Code Quality & Pre-commits**: Pre-commit hooks with `ruff` for linting/formatting and `mypy` for static type checking
- **Testing Framework**: `pytest` setup with basic test structure for core functionality

### Key Features:

- **Batch Data Input**: Process YouTube URLs from configuration file
- **CLI with Argparse**: Command-line interface accepting config file path (`autovision --config config.yaml`)
- **Hugging Face Model Integration**: Pre-trained object detection models with automatic download capability
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Reproducible keyframe sampling based on configurable frequency (stores timestamps, not frames)
- **Configuration File**: `config.yaml` defines project settings including sampling frequency
- **Output Format**: Single COCO JSON file with predictions and timestamp metadata
- **Error Handling**: Common error handling for YouTube API limits, video availability, model inference failures

### Testing:

- Unit tests for keyframe extraction reproducibility
- Integration tests for model loading and inference
- CLI interface testing
